# cacophony-processing

This is a server side component that runs alongside the Cacophony
Project API, performing post-upload processing tasks.

Currently it feeds CPTV (Cacophony Project Thermal Video) files
obtained from the Cacophony Project API to an external classifier. The
tags and MP4 files generated by the classifier are fed back to the API
server. Other tasks will be added soon.

## Configuration

cacophony-processing requires access to the Cacophony API's
`fileProcessing` API as well as direct access to the API's backing
object store. Copy `config_TEMPLATE.yaml` to `config.yaml` and edit as
appropriate.

## Installing & Running

The processing component requires Python 3. Use of virtualenv is highly recommended.

Install dependencies like this:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run like this:

```
python thermal_processing.py
```
